Enhanced Multi-Agent Simulation with Quantum-Inspired Decision-Making
This project presents an innovative multi-agent simulation framework that integrates quantum-inspired decision-making, evolutionary behavior, dynamic attention mechanisms, and real-time interaction with a dynamic environment. The agents in this simulation are capable of evolving, interacting with each other and their environment, and making quantum-inspired decisions for optimal survival and reproduction.

The simulation features multiple agents competing for resources, dynamic obstacles, threats that target agents, and food sources that spawn and provide nutrients. As time passes, the environment evolves with new obstacles and threats, all governed by genetic-based improvements such as agent size, speed, health, and energy consumption.

Key Features
1. Multi-Agent Interactions
A group of agents (bots) in a simulated environment where each agent has unique behaviors influenced by genetic algorithms, dynamic attention, and quantum decision-making.
Each agent adapts, evolves, and interacts with the environment and other agents, with reproduction mechanisms that produce offspring with evolutionary improvements.
2. Quantum-Inspired Decision-Making
Agents make decisions based on quantum-inspired randomness, using a quantum decision-making layer to enhance their decision processes.
Quantum randomness is used to determine agent actions, creating variability and adaptability in the simulation, while reinforcement learning principles are applied to improve decision accuracy over time.
3. Dynamic Attention Mechanism
Agents adjust their attention scale dynamically based on their environment and state, allowing them to focus more on nearby threats, food, or obstacles.
The attention scale is controlled in real-time through a UI slider, allowing for experimentation with different levels of agent awareness.
4. Evolutionary Behavior
Agents evolve over time based on their survival and reproduction success. Genetic algorithms are used to determine which traits are passed down to offspring, including size, speed, health, and energy consumption.
The reproduction rate is adjustable, and agents undergo mutations to introduce variation into the population.
5. Real-Time Interaction with the Environment
Dynamic obstacles, food sources, and threats spawn and interact with agents. Obstacles respawn and move over time, while threats target and attack agents, influencing their health.
Food sources provide nutrition, and once consumed, they respawn elsewhere in the environment.
Agents must avoid obstacles, fight threats, and gather food for survival.
6. Threats and Combat
Threats actively seek out and engage with agents. Threats have health and can be defeated by agents through combat.
Agents engage in combat with threats, damaging them when in close proximity. If the threat's health reaches zero, it is despawned.
Threats respawn over time and are more aggressive the longer they are active.
7. Real-Time UI Controls
A control panel allows users to interact with and modify key parameters of the simulation:
Agent Speed Control: Real-time adjustment of agent speed.
Simulation Reset: Reset the entire simulation, restoring the environment and agents to their initial state.
8. Environment Evolution
The environment changes dynamically, with new obstacles and threats continuously spawned throughout the simulation.
The spawn rates for threats and obstacles increase over time, keeping the agents engaged and adaptive.
How to Use
Start the simulation by opening the index.html file in a browser.
Adjust agent speed using the Agent Speed slider in the control panel.
Use the Reset Simulation button to reset the agents and environment to their initial states.
Watch as agents evolve, interact with the environment, and make quantum-inspired decisions.
Future Improvements
Enhanced Quantum Decision Layer: Integrate actual quantum computing frameworks like Qiskit to further improve decision-making processes.
Multiplayer: Enable real-time interactions between multiple users controlling agents.
Advanced Agent Evolution: Incorporate more complex genetic algorithms for agent traits, improving adaptability in more complex environments.
